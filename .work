Add array collectors

Filters:
- check if YCbCr works, if not, delete it <- done
- clean up color package <- done
- gray -> grey <- wrong
- some edge -> convolve <- wrong
- rotate != morphology <- done
- noise -> copy from ImageNoise, should we use JSC? <- not yet
- clean up statistical <- done
- abstract package + clean up <- done
- add scaling

performance tests:
- no idea what to think about this module

documentation:
- get random images from set instead of lena all the time, will make it look more alive
- update with new filters and proper examples

core:
- delete channel operation, noone ever uses it and its cpu heavy <- done
- pack setUp, tearDown methods so they dont have to call super in implementations
- getHistograms should propably be in UnpackedImage instead of filter, same for setPixel checking
