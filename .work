Add array collectors

Filters:
- noise -> copy from ImageNoise, should we use JSC? <- not yet
- add scaling

performance tests:
- no idea what to think about this module

documentation:
- get random images from set instead of lena all the time, will make it look more alive - done
- update with new filters and proper examples - 50/50

core:
- pack setUp, tearDown methods so they dont have to call super in implementations
- getHistograms should propably be in UnpackedImage instead of filter, same for setPixel checking
